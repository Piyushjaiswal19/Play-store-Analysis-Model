# Play-store-Analysis-Model
This is a Play-store analysis Model in which we analyze the various aspect of the app such as rating , price ,size, no. of downloads, and how the user behaves when the price of certain apps is higher or the rating of certain app is low, what are their preferences . The model give analysis about the behaviour of the users on what metric they decide whether the app is good or not . It also explains the effect of price on rating and number of doenloads. In the model I have taken the dataset from uci-machine learning repository, I have made this model with the help of basics python libraries such as pandas, numpy ,seaborn and have created various data visualization graphs and chart for better understanding the model.                                                                                                               
In the model first I have taken the data set in the form of csv file and then perform several operation on it .                        
Firstly I have pre processed the data and remove all the null values and the data which has some abnormalities.                      
Later I have divided the data set into training and testing data.                                                               
Then, I perfromed various operations to get our desired ouput.                                                                  
The overall analysis of the app is that lighter apps are prefered in place of heavier apps and when the price of the app is increased there is significant decline in the rating.
