# Play-store-Analysis-Model
This is a Play-store analysis Model in which has the accuracy of over 85 percent. In this model I have predicted whether the user uses the app which are highly rated or the apps which are low in size. In the model I have taken the dataset from uci-machine learning repository, I have made this model with the help of basics python libraries such as pandas, numpy ,seaborn and have created various data visualization graphs and chart for better understanding the model.
In the model first I have taken the data set in the form of csv file and then perform several operation on it .
Firstly I have pre processed the data and remove all the null values and the data which has some abnormalities.
Later I have divided the data set into training and testing data.
Then, I perfromed various operations to get our desired ouput.
